# Moving Beyond Excel and Becoming More Data Science-y
Resources from [Tim Wilson's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tgwilson/) presentation: "Moving Beyond Excel and Becoming More Data Science-y"

## Books

* [Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Business-Data-Analytic-Thinking/dp/1449361323) by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett -- this is not an _easy_ read, but, if you can stick with it (or find a friend to read it with), it provides a great introduction to a number of pretty key concepts.
* [The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail--but Some Don't](https://www.amazon.com/Signal-Noise-Many-Predictions-Fail-but/dp/0143125087) by Nate Silver -- this isn't tied directly to business, but Silver does a great job of explaining how to think about data differently.
* [Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Bets-Making-Smarter-Decisions/dp/0735216355/) -- I'm breaking my rule of only listing resources I have read/used; _but_, from hearing Duke on podcasts and reading some interviews, I'm 100% convinced this book walks through the "big concept" covered in the back half of the presentation

## Blogs/Online Resources

* Measure Slack
* Conductrics Blog

## Code Examples

These examples all use R because, well, that's what they were built with. A little creative Googling should turn up how to do the same thing with Python:

* Visits and Pageviews for All Adobe Analytics Report Suites
* Network Diagram
* Twitter Mining

## Podcasts

* [The Digital Analytics Power Hour](https://analyticshour.io)
* [This Week in Machine Learning and AI](https://twimlai.com/)

## Diving into Coding

* [Choosing between R and Python: A Digital Analystâ€™s Guide](https://medium.com/innovation-machine/choosing-between-r-and-python-a-digital-analysts-guide-b7103f80aa4e) -- great article comparing the two platforms from a "Which one should I learn?" perspective by Alexandros Papageorgiou
* [dartistics.com](http://dartistics.com) -- website designed to walk digital analysts through learning R (check out [dartistics.com/googleanalytics](http://dartistics.com/googleanalytics) for complete, copy-and-pastable examples for Google Analytics and, likewise, [dartistics.com/adobeanalytics](http://dartistics.com/adobeanalytics) for examples for Adobe Analytics)
* If learning R and using Google Analytics, Mark Edmondson's [googleAnalyticsR](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/) is a very useful package (and is extensively documented)
* [R for Marketing Research and Analytics (Use R!)](https://www.amazon.com/Marketing-Research-Analytics-Use/dp/3319144359/) by Chris Chapman and Elea McDonnell Feit
